How to retreive and upload source code to Arduino:  
Step 1) Download zip folder of code.  
Step 2) Extract folder to desired file location.  
Step 3) The Solid_Main.ino file and Solid_Animation.ino must both be within a folder together named Solid_Main. Rename folder to match.  
Step 4) Open Solid_Main.ino and adjust variables as required (output pin, number of LEDs, etc.).  
Step 5) Upload sketch to Arduino.
